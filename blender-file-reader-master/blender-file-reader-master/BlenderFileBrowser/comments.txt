# This file holds comments for the program. Comments are in the form:
# [TypeName]
# (this)=Comment about the type itself, which should not contain newlines
# fieldname=Comment about the field named fieldname, which should not contain newlines
# Lines beginning with a # are comments. Technically, any line not beginning with a [ is a comment, until a 
# [ is found, then all lines not beginning with a # are parsed until a seperating newline is found, repeat.
